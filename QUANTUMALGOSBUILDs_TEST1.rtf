You need to take two programs: options_trading_execution.py and qnn_0dte.py and create a new blended python file that takes these two files as input for outputted trade execution off of tracking BT SIM results to live trading. Our main hypothesis question for our main new main program quantum algo is if our backtest simulation is tracking to live performance (if it was executed as working out of same shared backtest simulation outputted results sub-folder within sub-repo as our main OPEN SOURCE MODEL MY V0OSS MODEL IMPLEMENTATION TO INSTANTLY TRANSMIT FILES AS SUPPLY SYNTHETIC CSV TO AI DEMAND MODEL CIRCULATED TO PARTNERS AND MEET NETWORK LOAD DEMAND PER TRADER CREATING AI GENERATED NEW PROGRAM. The tracking question is answered by me but you must create first a functionalized docstring that gives the reader the clearly expressed concepts of newly generated main quantum algorithm and secured with basic sha algo checksum with quantum cryptographic toolset to meet minimum requirements for our own porting bonds to crypto//AI. then port this early efficacy aka early model efficacy with earliest arrival of profits//alpha and port success early efficacy model porting to our quantum trading backtest sim same shared sim proxy to live trading and in-built embedded sha rsa encryption private to public generated sha key (github commit sha per sub-folder model OSS port model here for automation in-built maximally exploit our paid for services and my own source model to public oss bounty hunt V0OSS model on my github sub-repo.
