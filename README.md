Institutional Algorithmic Trading Code (Retail Market - Alpha)

IV % mean-reversion off highest minute SPX volume (retail sales; self-financing), Uses:
  - Institutional Market Maker Hedge: Long volatility hedge to HFT alpha (options sales biased), which is undiversified across time (infinitesimally small holding periods; static bid/ask spread arbitrage)

Speculation (Only Institutional, Not investment advice, Institutions: limit max. exposure to <2.0%; based on institutional hedging exposure needs):
  - Fractional-Kelly Criterion Betting: Self-financing using a fraction of winnings for subsequent betting on volatile auto-correlated days
      - Greater $ winnings overall/self-financing greater future bets for potentially exponential portfolio growth
        - Make a few greater bets early for chance of multiplying the initial base early-on, then quickly reduce future bettings to secure winnings
          - Close mini-portfolio for week once 3-5X target is hit; rinse-repeat
    - Deploy programmable batches of capital. To be deployed ("server kicks on") on certain volatile days, with a focus on Friday's expiration
    - Feel free to contact me if you or your firm would like fractional-kelly integrated into this program

Benefits:
Provides emergency liquidity and better pricing for retail AND institutional market makers at their instantaneous points of risk (position entry/exit)

P/L: Width of spread and premium paid defines capital at risk/profit. Strategy should be defined around investor preferences/objectives (hedging/speculation)
